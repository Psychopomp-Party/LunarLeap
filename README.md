## [Lunar Leap](https://psychopomp.itch.io/lunar-leap)
A simple game made for the [Game Off 2020](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2020) game jam.
##### Description
You're a moon dweller trying to protect your dwelling from strange spacecrafts. The spacecraft don't seem to stop landing on your moon and shooting hurty orbs everywhere. Better bump into them to get them to disappear.
##### Development
One should be able to simply use Godot's *Import Existing Project* dialog to modify this project.
##### Game Jam Notes
The were a few goals with this project: learn some of the basics of the Godot game engine, learn basic rigging and animation in Blender, and to complete a game project within the time limit of the game jam.

I feel like I met those goals and got a fairly reasonable resulting game. Do note though that there are some slight issues with the project. Such as: messy GDScript, lack optimization, and somewhat lacking resource organization. Those are certainly things I'll work on with future projects.
